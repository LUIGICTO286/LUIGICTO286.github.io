The Luigi Movement Manifesto

To everyone fighting for a fairer future, we are the Luigi Movement. We are not here to condone violence, crime, or chaos of any kind. We stand for systemic change—peaceful, purposeful, and bold. Our mission is to revolutionize the global healthcare system, starting with the glaring injustices in America.

The United States, with the most expensive healthcare system in the world, ranks shockingly low in life expectancy. Millions struggle or perish under crushing medical bills, while corporations grow wealthier on the backs of human suffering. This isn’t just an American issue; it’s a global crisis. No healthcare system is perfect, but the burden of unfairness and inequality exists everywhere.

Our goal is simple: to build a community so strong, so united, that together we can bear the weight of these costs and offer relief to those in need. We are powered by the Solana blockchain, ensuring transparency, efficiency, and global accessibility. This isn’t just about America—it’s about creating a worldwide movement for health, justice, and humanity.

We are the Luigi Movement, and $LUIGI is our cash tag. Together, we will rise as a beacon of hope for everyone who has ever felt powerless against a broken system. This is more than a revolution; it’s a call to unite and act for the future we all deserve.
